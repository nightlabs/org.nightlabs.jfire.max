Comment: Update notes:
  From 1.0.0 to 1.0.1, there have been 2 fields added to Offer - DataNucleus
  is able to update the datastore itself. Additionally, the workflow Offer/vendor has
  been modified to fix issue https://www.jfire.org/modules/bugs/view.php?id=1188 which
  will not be re-persisted, though, because we didn't release 1.0 yet and it's a minor bug.
