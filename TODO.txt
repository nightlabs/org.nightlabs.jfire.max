Important note: JFireGeography will soon undergo heavy refactoring, because it currently doesn't support
overwriting/adding of information via the root organisation. Correctly, the data read from the current CSVs
must be marked coming from the devil organisation (NOT from the root orga as it is now).
Additionally, there should be a second set of CSV files that come from the root organisation.
But in order to work with CSV files, we first need a resource adapter
managing the filesystem like a database (with transactions and snapshots of the files).

Alternatively, we could store this second set of CSV files in the database (as BLOB fields of a JDO object).
This has two advantages:
- We do not need to write the FileSystemResourceAdapter.
- We have ALL data in the database (=> easier for backups).
