<!-- Reporting Initialiser DTD for ReportTextParts - version 0.1 -->
<!-- Author: Alexander Bieber -->

<!-- 
  While the report intialiser scans through directories and intialises
  report categories and report layouts it will also look for files
  named like {reportRegistryItemID}.ReportTextPartConfiguration.xml
  where reportRegistryItemID is the last part of the id of the currently
  initialised report item (category or report).
  
  If such a file is found its contents will be used to create/update
  a ReportTextPartConfiguration linked to the item currently initialised.
  
  This is the dtd of these files.  
-->

<!--
  reportTextPartConfiguration is the document main element.
  A file should only contain one such element and that element
  might contain one or more reportTextPart elements
-->
<!ELEMENT reportTextPartConfiguration ( reportTextPart+ ) >

<!--
  A <reportTextPartConfiguration> is made up of a list of <reportTextPart>s 
  Each <reportTextPart> defines an id that the created ReportTextPart will
  have in the ReportTextPartConfiguration created.
  Additionally each <reportTextPart> needs to define the type of its content.

<!-- 
  <name> elements are used to define a <reportTextPart>s i18n name.
  They are used like
  <name language="en">MyName</name>

<!-- 
  The <content> element is used to define the content of a 
  reportTextPart. It is an i18n text of large strings.
